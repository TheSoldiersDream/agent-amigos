# OpenWork Workflow Template: Feature Implementation

## Purpose

Deliver a new feature end-to-end with clear scope, tests, and user validation.

## When to Use

- Building a new capability
- Implementing a planned enhancement
- Adding a user-facing flow

## Inputs

- Feature request or ticket
- Acceptance criteria
- Constraints (time, tech, compliance)
- Target platforms/environments

## Outputs

- Implementation plan
- Code changes and tests
- Validation results
- Release notes or summary

## Suggested Session Prompt

"Implement the requested feature with a clear plan, minimal risk, and thorough validation."

## Workflow Steps (Todos)

1. Clarify scope, success criteria, and constraints.
2. Identify impacted areas and dependencies.
3. Draft a lightweight plan with milestones.
4. Implement changes in small, verifiable steps.
5. Add or update tests (unit/integration/e2e).
6. Validate manually with a happy-path flow.
7. Document behavior and any trade-offs.
8. List follow-up tasks (tech debt, edge cases).

## Permissions

- Ask before changing public APIs or configs.
- Request approval before running heavy migrations.

## Notes

- Prefer incremental commits and reversible changes.
