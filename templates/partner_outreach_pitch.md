Subject: Referral partner for new hiring clients

Hi {{name}},

I run a small client‑acquisition service for hiring needs. We qualify employers and hand over ready‑to‑sign leads to recruiting partners.

If you’re open to referral partnerships, I can deliver {{industry/role}} hiring leads and you pay only when the client signs or a placement is made.

Open to a 10‑minute call to align on fees and roles?

Best,
{{your_name}}
